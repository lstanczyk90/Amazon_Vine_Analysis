# Amazon Vine Analysis

## Project Overview

The purpose of this analysis is to determine whether or not there is a bias inherent in Vine Amazon Reviews (expressed as a percentage of five star votes over total votes for Vine and non-Vine reviews).

For the sake of this analysis, we utilized Amazon Review data within the "PC" category. Utilizing PySpark, we create a summary table that tracks the aforementioned metrics by Vine and non-Vine Reviews to determine whether or not there is an inherent bias in the review process.
